      These examples illustrate how to use the igpp.docgen tool with table data.
      </p>
      <p>Table data is arranged as records composed of fields. Each field contains a value.
         A table can contain any number of records and the number and order of fields in
         each record is the same. Each field can have a name so that it can referenced.
      </p>
      <p>igpp.docgen supports delimited tables where each field is delineated by a field
         delimiter. The default delimiter is a comma (,). Other delimiters can be used. 
         When they are it must be specified on command-line with the "-s" option.
      </p>
      <p>When igpp.docgen parses a table it looks for the first non-commented line and uses
         that to determine the names for each field and how many fields should be in record.
      </p>
      <p>igpp.docgen also supports comments in a table file. Any line beginning with "#" is
         considered a comment. The content of all comments are assigned to the "description"
         attribute of the generated velocity context.
      </p>
