   	<h3>Scenario</h3>
   	<p>
      Create an HTML table listing the columns in a PDS3 label that describes a table.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Our PDS3 describes a data table. It has four column: time stamp, Br, Bt and Bphi.
         We want to create an HTML table to list the columns.

      </p>
      <p>Out label is the same one created with the <a href="generate.html">generated example</a>.
         Our PDS3 label looks like:</p>

      <p>We will store this in a file called <a href="timeseries.lbl">timeseries.lbl</a>.</p>
      <p>Our velocity template looks like:</p>
<div class="code">
<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
&lt;p>
$label.DESCRIPTION
&lt;/p>
#foreach ($table in $label.TABLE)
&lt;table>
   &lt;thead>
   &lt;tr>
      &lt;th>Name&lt;/th>&lt;th>DataType&lt;/th>&lt;th>Bytes&lt;/th>&lt;th>StartByte&lt;/th>
   &lt;/tr>
   &lt;/thead>
   &lt;tbody>
#foreach( $column in $table.COLUMN) 
   &lt;tr>
      &lt;td>$column.NAME&lt;/td>
      &lt;td>$column.DATA_TYPE&lt;/td>

      &lt;td>$column.BYTES&lt;/td>
   &lt;/tr>
#end
   &lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
#end
</pre>
</div>
      <p>We will store this in a file called <a href="example-html.vm">example-html.vm</a>.</p>
      <p>In the template we expect our label to be in a context called "label" (which is established
         on the command line - see below). When a PDS3 label is parsed the name sof varaibles matches
         the keyword and the nesting of variables in the context mirrors the nesting of objects in
         the label. Each object is defines according to its class (last word of the value assign to 
         the OBJECT keyword). All objects are placed in arrays even when this is only one object.
         This means that iterating over an object you always need to use a "#foreach". This is 
         convienent since you can have highly adaptive Velocity templates.
         
         For our template the DESCRIPTION in the label is placed before the table. Then for each
         COLUMN the value of NAME, DATA_TYPE, START_BYTES, and BYTES is wrapped in HTML table field
         tags.
         with XML tags.</p>
      <p>Running igpp.docgen with the command:</p>
<div class="code">
java -jar igpp-docgen.jar label:timeseries.lbl -f html example-html.vm
</div>
      <p>Instructs igpp.docgen to parse the file "timeseries.lbl" and place the results in a context
         named "label". Since the extension on "timeseries.lbl" is ".lbl" igpp.docgen will parse the
         file as a PDS3 label. The output will be formatted as HTML (-f html)</p>
      <p>Running this command will generate an XML document that looks like:</p>
