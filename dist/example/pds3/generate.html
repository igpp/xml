   	<h3>Scenario</h3>
   	<p>
      Create a PDS3 label that describes a data table.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Our data is a table contains a time series of data.
         It has four fields: time stamp and and 3D vector.
         We want to create an PDS3 label that describes the
         data table.
      </p>
      <p>Our data table looks like:</p>
<div class="code">

      <p>We will store this in a file called <a href="timeseries.tab">timeseries.tab</a>.</p>
      <p>Since this a fixed width, plain text file without header information we need
         additional information in order to describe the layout and content of the
         table. For each field we will need know the name, units, data type, 
         start byte, width, and a short description. We will also need to have 
         a description of the data. A CSV file is a convienent way to store
         this information. For the example table this would be:</p>
<div class="code">
<pre>
# Cassini magnetic-field 1 minute averages for the year 2012 in RTN
# coordinates. RTN coordinates consist of R (radial component, Sun to
# the spacecraft), T (tangential component, parallel to the Solar
# Equatorial plane and perpendicular to R), and N (normal component,
# completes right handed set).
#
# These MAG data were processed (calibrated, rotated into RTN
# coordinates, and averaged) by the Cassini MAG team at Imperial
# College. They were provided to PDS by the MAG team Co-I at UCLA.
# Trajectory and the number of points in the average were added at the
# PDS/PPI node. For more information on this and previous versions,
# please refer to the PDS catalog file for this data set
# (CO_MAG_CAL_1MIN_DS.CAT).
Name	Number	Unit	Data_Type	Start_Byte	Bytes	Description
TIME	1	N/A	TIME	1	19	Spacecraft event time of the sample.
BR	2	nT	ASCII_REAL	21	10	The radial component (R) points from the Sun to the spacecraft,positive away from the Sun.
BT	3	nT	ASCII_REAL	32	10	RTN tangetial (T) component of the magnetic field in nT. T is parallel to the Solar Equatorial plane (Omega[Sun] x R).
BPHI	4	nt	ASCII_REAL	42	10	RTN normal (N) component of the magnetic field in nT. N completes the right handed set, and is roughly normal to the Solar Equatorial plane.

      <p>Our velocity template will be a PDS3 label with some information already filled in.
         Information specific to the table (columns, record count, file size, etc.) will be generate

      <p>We will store this in a file called <a href="example-pds3.vm">example-pds3.vm</a>.</p>
      <p>In the template we expect information about the table (description and fields) to be in 
         a context called "layout" and the name of the data file to be passed on the command-line
         (which appears in the "options" context).
         
         This template uses methods to determine some information. For example, the MD5 checksum
         is calcualted by calling the getMD5() method of the File context, passing the file name
         provided on the command line. See: $File.getMD5($options.data_file). It also uses the
         floor() and perform() methods of the Calc context to determine the number of records (rows)
         in the file. Finally, it uses the getBaseName() method of the File context to
         extract the base name of the data file and assigned it to the PRODUCT_ID which is 
         a convention when creating PDS3 labels.
      </p>
      <p>Running igpp.docgen with the command:</p>
<div class="code">
java -jar igpp-docgen.jar data_file=timeseries.tab record_bytes=54 layout:fields.csv -f pds3 example-pds3.vm
</div>
      <p>Instructs igpp.docgen to parse the file "fields.csv" and place the results in a context
         named "layout". Since the extension on "fields.csv" is ".csv" igpp.docgen will parse the
         file as a set of tab separated values, creating a record for each non-commented line in 
         the file. We also specify that the output should be well formatted PDS3 metadata (-f pds3).</p>
      <p>Running this command will generate an XML document that looks like:</p>
